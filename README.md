# PythonKerasApplication

### Created April 16 2018
This application is meant to showcase useful examples of applied Deep Learning with the Keras interface. In time it can also be used on new situations.

Initially it can be used on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

Start the application

python MainApplication.py

Command to install dependencies
$ pip install numpy scipy scikit-learn tensorflow pillow h5py keras

#### Example projects
In addition to the basic Keras app there are a number of showcase applications. These integrate Keras into everyday applications such as image recognition, a game and stock market app.

1. Simple REST API app: allow user to train and test an image.
2. Simple RNN stock market app.
3. Simple game AI.
4. Simple graph and interface app.
