TensorFlow models

Checkpoint: captures exact values of paramters. Do not contain description of computation and so can only be used with source code.

It cosists of the following files
	.ckpt: binary file
	.index
	.data: contains training variables.
	checkpoint: keeps track of latest checkpoint files saved
	
Before 0.11 there was also a .meta file but this has been deprecated.

Saving a model checkpoint has to been done inside a session.

Restoring a checkpoint is an important step to continue training or to saved to SavedModel.

TF1
with tf.Session() as sess:
	loader = tf.train.import_meta_graph("checkpoint_file.meta" )
	loader.restore(sess,"checkpoint_file")

TF2
ckpt = tf.train.Checkpoint(...)
status = ckpt.restore('path/to/that/directory/ckpt-12')
# ... make sure the variables are created
status.assert_consumed() 

builder = tf.compat.v1.saved_model.builder.SavedModelBuilder(export_dir)
builder.add_meta_graph_and_variables(sess, [tf.saved_model.TRAINING, tf.saved_model.SERVING], strip_default_attrs=True)
builder.save()

SavedModel: includes serialzied description of the computation as well as the paramter values.
Models in this format are independent of their source code.
